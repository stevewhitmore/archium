# Archium [ar'kiyum] - "*the archives*"

Archium is an application meant to act as a personal learning suite in the form of a personalized wiki, flash cards, and an admin section to track progress and plan future learning. It's also in the process of being upgraded to meet [Progressive Web App standards](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Inspired by Ben Vacha's [Specter](https://github.com/benvacha/specter).

## This is a work in progress

Due to having multiple jobs and a family to take up most of my time the projected deployment date of v1 is... whenever I get around to finishing it. Between now and then I have a series of tasks to complete which are being tracked over in the [project issues](https://github.com/stevewhitmore/archium/issues) section.

## Running Locally

```git clone <repo>```

```cd web && npm i && npm start```

and it'll run on localhost:4200
