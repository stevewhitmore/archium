# Archium [ar'kiyum]  - (Web)
### "*the archives*" 

A simple application for keeping record of the things that matter.

---
This is the UI/frontend portion of the Archium application. It currently serves as a custom and personalized wiki application that I use for studying various topics. It's in the process of being extended to include more functionality such as flash cards, an admin section to track progress, and a planner to better focus my learning.

Inspired by Ben Vacha's [Specter](https://github.com/benvacha/specter).
